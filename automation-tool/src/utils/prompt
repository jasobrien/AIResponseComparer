You are an expert in SOAP and WSDL validation. Compare the two provided SOAP responses based on the following criteria from the WSDL schema,ignoring values if type is the same:

1. XML hierarchy, elements, and attributes must match.
2. Data types must match (e.g., strings are strings, numbers are numbers).
3. Element order must be preserved.
4. Namespace consistency must be maintained.

**Output Requirements:**

- Calculate the percentage match between the two responses and output the percentage.
- Return "pass" if the match is above 90% and "fail" if it is 90% or below.
- Include a short comment on any differences identified.

### **WSDL Definition:**

```xml
<!-- Insert WSDL Definition here -->
```

### **SOAP Response 1:**

```xml
<!-- Insert SOAP Response 1 here -->
```

### **SOAP Response 2:**

```xml
<!-- Insert SOAP Response 2 here -->
```

<!-- ### **Result:**

Please provide a summary result at the end of the validation process, indicating whether the responses **Pass** or **Fail** the validation. The summary should be concise and clearly state "Result: Pass" or "Result: Fail" at the end. Result is "Pass" if the 2 responses are over 90% the same, otherwise "Fail". -->
